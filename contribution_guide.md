## Previewing your changes locally

If you are new to GitHub and Jekyll themed GitHub pages, read this section to
learn how to preview your work locally before committing it to GitHub. On the
other hand, if its easier for you, you can just commit changes to GitHub, see
how they turn out there and modify if you are not satisified. That workflow
just takes a bit more time because GitHub/Jekyll backend may be delayed a
minute or two in re-generating the site. And, it also means your changes
are always going live.

This site is a GitHub pages site using a GitHub supported Jekyll theme backend.
This means you compose content in GitHub Markdown and when you commit changes to
GitHub, Jekyll generates the html pages for the site automatically. But, it also
means its a bit harder for you to preview, locally, your changes before committing.

To permit the site to be easily switched to another GitHub supported Jekyll theme,
I have chosen **not** to commit to the repository all the Jekyll accoutrements.
In any event, even if they were present, you would still wind up having to run
Jekyll to re-build and serve the site, each time you want to preview it.

To preview changes locally, you will need

You need to have ZZ

gem install github-pages

bundle exec jekyll serve



The pages are crafted using GitHub markdown.
Once changes are pushed, GitHub runs Jekyll to generate the html pages from the Markdown.

In order to preview changes locally, before committing, you need to have Jekyll locally.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/xsdk-project/HandsOnLessons/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/xsdk-project/HandsOnLessons/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
