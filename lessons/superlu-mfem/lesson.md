* **Questions** are the those things we want learners to know the answers to by the end of the lesson.
We don't have to list all possible questions here...only the two or three _most_ important.
* **Objectives** are those things we want learners to actually do or observe during the lesson. Again,
only list here the ones that are _most_ important.
* **Key Points** are those things we want learners to take-away from the lesson.

## The problem being solved

The example is modeling the steady state convection-diffusion equation in 2D
with a constant velocity.  This equation is used to model the concentration
of something in a fluid as it diffuses and flows through the fluid.
The equation is as follows:
    Del dot (kappa Del u) â€“ Del dot (v u) + R = 0

Where u is the concentration that we are tracking, kappa is the diffusion rate,
v is the velocity of the flow and R is a concentration source.
 
In the application the velocity vector is pointing at +x and the magnitude is
set by the user (default of 100).  The kappa is fixed at 1.0, and the source
is 0.0 everywhere except for a small disc centered at the middle of the
domain where it is 1.0.
 
This problem is well known to give iterative solvers trouble. 
We use MFEM and SuperLU_DIST (http://crd-legacy.lbl.gov/~xiaoye/SuperLU/)
to demonstrate the use of a direct solver to solve very ill-conditioned
linear systems.

### Run 2: increase velocity to 1000, GMRES does not converge anymore

```
Options used:
   --refine 0
   --order 1
   --velocity 1000
   --no-visit
   --no-superlu
   --slu-colperm 0

  cpu MFLOPS      = 0.000000

```

### Run 3: Now use SuperLU_DIST, with default options
```
$ ./convdiff -slu --velocity 1000

Options used:
   --refine 0
   --order 1
   --velocity 1000
   --no-visit
   --superlu
   --slu-colperm 0
Number of unknowns: 10201
