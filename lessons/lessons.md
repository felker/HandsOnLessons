------------

As described in [Welcome to HandsOnLessons](../README.md), hosted here are a series of increasingly sophisticated hands-on lessons aimed at helping users of all experience levels learn to use a variety of high-performance scientific software packages for solving complex numerical problems.  This collection is just beginning; over time, more lessons will be provided to cover other important topics and packages.  

* [Basic, One Dimensional Heat Equation](hand_coded_heat/lesson.md)
* [Time Integrators](time_integrators/lesson.md)
* [Algebraic Multigrid](AMG/lesson.md)
* [Finite Elements Convergence](convergence/lesson.md)
* [Adjoint Solvers](adjoint/lesson.md)
