Lessons
------------

As described in [Welcome to HandsOnLessons](../README.md), hosted here are a series of increasingly sophisticated hands-on lessons aimed at helping users of all experience levels learn to use a variety of high-performance scientific software packages for solving complex numerical problems.  This collection is just beginning; over time, more lessons will be provided to cover other important topics and packages.

* [Basic, One-Dimensional Heat Equation](hand_coded_heat/lesson.md)
* [Structured Meshes](AMReX/lesson.md)
* [Time Integrators](time_integrators/lesson.md)
* [Iterative Solvers](iterativesolvers/lesson.md)
* [Sparse Direct Solvers](superlu-mfem/lesson.md)
