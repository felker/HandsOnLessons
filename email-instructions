Dear ATPESC-2017 participants, Welcome to Numerical Packages Track of ATPESC-2017!

  This email includes instructions for setup tasks we would like you to complete prior to start of the day. If questions with any of these items, please email <<who to list here>>.

BASIC INSTRUCTIONS:

  1. We need you to pair-off in groups of 2 for hands-on exercises. Forming groups of 2 helps us cut in half the number of IT issues we may have to help people fix during hands-on and reduce the compute node resource requirements.

  2. Hands-on exercises are primarily run on cooley. Please do the following initial setup

    a. login to cooley.

ssh username@cooley.alcf.anl.gov

    b. setup software environment on cooley.
      i. Edit ~/.soft.cooley and add the following lines (preferably before '@default' line)

PATH+=/projects/ATPESC2017/NumericalPackages/spack/bin
+mvapich2
+gcc-4.8.1
@visit

      ii. run the following command to make the above change to ~/.soft.cooley effective

resoft

      iii. obtain compute nodes in interactive mode to run the hands on exercises by running the following qsub command. [for ex: requesting 3 nodes for 12h]

qsub -I -n 3 -t 720 -A ATPESC2017


  4. Now proceed to run the Hands-On exercises as instructed at <<URL?>>


OPTIONAL VISUALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS:

  1. Some of the hands-on exercises have optional visualization instructions. This requires a VNC connection from your laptop to cooley. We have a convince script (to be run on your laptop) that can help with setting up a VNC connection to cooley. It can work on MacOS, and with some Linux VNC clients (vinagre, vncviewer) and is fragile hence this is optional. This script will do several thingsâ€¦

     a. Logs you into cooley once with your token
     b. Sets up SSH Control Master so you only have to log into cooley with your token once for the whole day and password-less will work thereafter
     c. Reserves 3 nodes for 12h on cooley.
     d. Sets up a VNC connection to those nodes

   Please download the script from <URL> and run it as:

sh ./morning_setup.sh your_cooley_userid

  Notes:
     - If allocating nodes via this script - please deallocate nodes that you might have previously allocated [via basic instructions]

  Troubleshooting:
     - If you have a different preferred Linux VNC client - you should be able to use it to connect to the VNC connection that is already setup by this script. For eg:
krdc vnc://localhost:22590
     - When rerunning the script - if the ssh command to setup VNC tunnel fails - you might have to kill the 'ssh control master' process and restart again. On Linux - one can discover process this with:
netstat -tp |grep cooley


ADDITIONAL NOTES:

  1. If you are running a Windows laptop, please try to pair up with someone on OSX or Linux as we are unlikely to be helpful with troubleshooting problems on Windows.

  2. Hands-on exercises will be tight on time. So, interruptions during hands on will have to be minimized. In addition to a hands-on leader who will be running the exercises as a presentation, there will be several members of the Numerical Packages team walking the room ready to offer help on IT issues.

5. We will be providing each group with red and green sticky notes. If you are having IT issues, instead of raising hands and interrupting the lesson, we ask that you please place a red sticky note on the edge of your laptop display and wait for a room walker to see it and come help. If you correct the problem yourself before you are helped, remove the red note and replace it with green.

6. We are providing a sign-up sheet to arrange some one-on-one time with Numerical Packages experts in the evening. If you are interested, you must sign up prior to lunch. The link to the sign-up sheet is, https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7qTafuJuegFYTNkZ3c5WHZNZ0k When you sign up, include your name and your topic(s) of interest. We will arrange one-on-one schedule sometime after lunch. After dinner you may visit <link here> to see the schedule we have arranged and find the time(s) we assigned you to accommodate your request. This is a great opportunity to discuss detailed issues with experts in the field.
